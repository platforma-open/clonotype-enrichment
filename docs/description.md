# Overview

Calculates enrichment scores for clonotypes based on how their frequencies change across different conditions, identifying and ranking the most enriched clonotypes. This block is particularly useful for analyzing selection experiments such as phage display or yeast display, but can be applied to any experimental design where clonotype frequencies vary across conditions.

The block takes clonotype count data from different conditions and calculates enrichment scores that quantify the degree of enrichment for each clonotype, highlighting the most promising candidates and producing publication-ready plots.

The enriched clonotype data with enrichment scores can be used in downstream analysis blocks such as Antibody/TCR Lead Selection to identify top candidates for further characterization.
